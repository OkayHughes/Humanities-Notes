Early renaissance art and architecture
Giotto: fresco painting
	Last judgeemnt 
		Great chain of being
		Bishop selling indulgence?
		Lots of criticism of church officials
	Christ entering jerusalem
		People aren't stacked on top of each other
	Lamentation
		Diagonal right down to jesus' face
		Why is sky cut up?
		Painting on wet plaster: have to go fast
		Each jigsaw area is one application of plaster
		Differenty humidity --> it cracks
	Frescoes look a little pasty
	Not as rich as oil painting
Why does everyone look forward to renaissance:
	The renaissance has pleasurable art
	Advances in the renaissance
	Stuff up to this point is interesting, but not the greatest art
	This is the fun stuff
Time for renaissance
	Medieval is about god
	RENAISSANCE IS MAN
"Out of the sick gothic night, our eyes are opened to the glorious touch of the sun" -Rabelais, 1540
No more great chaint of being
	"There are no limits to what man can accomplish" -Mirandola
	"To man it is gratned to have whatever he chooses, to be whatever he wills" 
Important notes on renaissance
	It's about humanism
	Still quite religious, but the emphasis is on what we can achieve while we're here
	Cultural term, not really stylistic
	Renaissance starts in italy about 1400
	Starts in 1500 in the north
	Economics --> art
	Who pays for the art? 
		This changes in the renaissance
		Suddenly there are private buyers of art
	Italy --> renaissance starts with sculpture
Duomo of florence
	Baptistry?
		romanesque construction
		1400 decide to spruce it up
		Have competiton
		Make doors
		abraham sacrificing isaac
		Must fit in quatrefoil
		Must be cast in bronze
		Burnelleschi
		Ghiberti wins
		NICE CONTRAPPOSTO
		Ghiberti looks back to classicism
	Ghiberti does door
	Flaggelation of christ
		So much movement
		Contrapposto christ
		All about the individuals
		Relief
	East doors
		Gates of paradise
		The east doors aren't the real doors?
