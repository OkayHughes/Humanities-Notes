* Notes on The Code of Hammurabi
  - Does #1 stem from ignominy and honor being highly disincentivised?
  - #2 shows the divinity of the river, also as the great adjudicator
  - Death was not treated as a last resort. What were thoughts about afterlife?
  - Despite common ownership, private property is still protected from other commoners  
  - Life as compensation for property.
  - Slaves are separate class of people, 15 and 16
  - The legal system is based around keeping them in slavery, given legally 
    mandated payment for capturing a slave 
  - Is 21 based around public display, or what?
  - Chattle, Livestock, property
  - Palace people and associated property are significantly more protected
  - 23 has lots of potential for fraud (if you don't mind the risk of dying)
  - The onus of protecting a life is on the city?
