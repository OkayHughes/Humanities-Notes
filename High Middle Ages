High middle ages
What happens to the little brothers?
	Primogeniture --> inheritance
1000 - 1300 --> High middle ages
	Warmer weather
	Greater prosperity
	Greater emphasis on Mary
	Virgin mary --> our mother --> notre dame
		Less emphasis on judgement
		Emphasis on grace, loving kindness, protection
		Emphasis on mercy
	So much emphasis on saints
	Saints are anyone who has been baptized initially
	Then becomes someone who has proved their merit
		Almost being killed for faith, surviving, then being killed for their faith
		People pray to saints
		Not as if gods or goddesses?
	Growth of towns and learning
Mendicant orders
	St Francis --> mendicant order
	mendicant --> beggars
	Begging for food
	Originally chose to be homeless and get everything through begging
		Also through abbot
		Direct response to safety of Benedictine orders
	Saint Dominic
		Order of the preachers
		Dominican Friars
		Friar = brother
		End up being associated with censorship
	Saint Francis
		Wanted to live as much like Jesus as possible
		Begun as Giovanni, knight and troubadour 
		Be as poor as possible, serving poor
		Franciscan friars
		Teach, but serve poor
	Little brother:
		Francis stood in line to inherit	
		Pope gets worried
		Francis writes rule, creates rule
		Poor Clares
	Francis loved the world
		He is drawn to nature, it is drawn to him
Feudalization of the church
	Control investure, secular rulers control church
	Investiture --> bestowing office upon someone 
	Secular lords' younger brothers who have nothing to do
		End up being made abbot or bishop
		Lords get along well with spiritual leaders
	Don't choose the most devout people
	Secular rulers demand that religious officials be like vassals
	Because wealth allows bishops and abbots to live well
		Seen as fief
		Expected to give a gift
		Begins to look like buying and selling office
		Church leaders think it sounds like corruption
	Church fights back
		Pope gregory VII (hildebrand)
		Begins to clean up church, remove secular control
		Kings don't get to choose abbots, bishops
		Pope has final say
		Goes to saint peter
		St. Peter with two swords
			Papal monarchy
			Divine and secular power
			Peter gives second sword to secular leaders
		Imperial papacy --> papal monarchy
		All power other people have comes from pope
Holy roman empire
	Emperor henry and pope excommunicate each other
	pope tells henry's vassals that they don't need to be loyal to him
	Henry goes to be forgiven
	Walks barefoot to papal residence
	Pope has to forgive him
The investiture controversy 	
Is empire fief of pope?
Is papacy a fief belonging to emperor?
