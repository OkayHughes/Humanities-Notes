The agony and the ecstasy?
About michalangelo and sistine chapel
Pope julius II plans to demolish St peter's basilica
	Thousand years old, 
	Build a new thing
	You will be know for the rest of time
Couple of people reasonable
	Bramante --> tempietto
	Michelangelo Buonarroti --> thought himself best architect
		Made his living as sculptor
	Bramante suggest the pope hire michalangelo paint sistine chapel
	Michalangelo was hated this idea
		Pope says "do it or I'll put you to death"
		Takes 3.5 years
	Bramante dies
	Michelangelo gets St. Peter's basilica design
	
Michalangelo makes it open central plan
Sistine chapel 
	Story of genesis
	Started with drunkenness of noah
	worked backwards
	Pagan ideas in there as well
	Up until expulsion panel
Altar
	Prophet jeremiah
		Melancholic
		Right above papal throne
	
	Bunch of awkward poses
	Julius had a bunch of things on his plate
	Libyan sibyl
		Really muscular babies
		Complementary colors
	God separating light from darkness
		Michelangelo's nudes
		Put in the panel
		Honor human body
		Belvere torso?!
		Enthralled with helenistic sculptures
		Used them
		Dug up with while he was painting
	 Creation of adam
		Gap
		Restored the painting
	Expulsion
		Massacio!
		Patterns expulsion after massacio
Delphic sibyl
	Why everyone so muscular
Drunkeness of noah is much more subdued
It is as if I hav crossed the sea, only to be put down in disgrace. What a torture to be left in such a state: poor, old, and a slave in someone else's power. I am undone if I do not die soon

Forced to paint the altarpiece
	From giotto to michalangelo
	Orderly to chaos
	History doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes
	Michalangelo didn't paint cloths and stuff
	THen they were covered up later
	THESE BODIES ARE GROSSLY MUSCLED
	Skin of st. bartholemew
	Put biagio in hell
	Snake biting his dick
Raphael --> raffaello sanzio
Quite popular
Employed hundreds of people painting madonnas and christ childs
Red in the middle, or triangular composition
Sistine madonna
	Pope sixtus was a della robia
