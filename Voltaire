Philosophical backdrop
If god is benevolent, why is there evil
	Theodicy
One way: humankind's fault
Combine original sin and free will

"God made man free to stand, but sufficient to fall" john milton
Response 2:
	Society's fault
	Rousseau
	(Obsessed with voltaire, sent him stuff, got rejected)
The manichees,
	god is not omnipotent
Maybe there's not evil,
	Our outlook is just limited
Philosophical optimism: pascal, leibnitz, pope
	If we look at it from the right perspective
	The world isn't evil
Using our reason to understand how everything is for the best
Leibnitz theodicee
"This system, having been crated by the loftiest and most benevolent of minds, must be, taken as a whole, the best of all possible sytens; within it, all events are linked by a chaing of cause and effect, and what looks to our limited view like evil and injustice, will, when the web of cuase and effect is unraveled, be found to cause greater compensating good"

"Far fropm consoling, the best of all posible worlds docrine is a doctrine of despair for those who embrace it. The question of good and evil remains an insoluble chaos for those who seek in good faith for an answer' it's a joke only for those who debate over it, they are slave0laboreres who play with their chains
"Some logicians have pretended that it isn't in the bnature of the being of all things..."
Voltaire
