The Great Fear
National assembly
July taking of bastille in paris
The great fear happens during that summer
Taking of bastille puts power behind 3rd estate claiming to be national assembly
Attack documents that list taxes
Destroyed
Followed by dissturbing violence?
	Raping and pillaging in the countryside
Rumors of nobility hiring homeless people to steal crops
Nobody knows who is in charge
National assembly abolishes feudalism
On august 4th
Pigeons. That explains it. Couldn't shoot pigeons because hunting rights are the lords
Purpose was to put stop to violence
	Also end oppression that led to this violence
Declaration of the rights of man and the citizen
Bunch of rights stuff

Freedom of religion unless it disturbs common good
1789 --> protestantism and judaism officially recognized

rights of man, not rights of french

fraternity etc

People in france are no longer subjects
Becomes politically incorrect to call them Mr. Mrs.
Mr means master
Mrs --> madam
DO NOT DO

Russian revolution --> comrade
kingdom --> nation

Women hahahahahahah lol no
Marie antoinette insults revolutionaries
	She insults them
Women lead that uprising
	Women act in the french revolution
Bring the king and queen to paris
Get to versailles
Kill some guards
Cut off heads and put them on pikes
Royal family forced to move to paris
Government moves to the heart of paris
Puts burgeoise government and king in paris
Revolutionary women's clubs

Leaders completely ignore it
	Rousseau said exactly the same thing
Olympe de Gouge
	Parody, but definitely serious
	She gets guillotined
	Believed in an english sort of constitutional monarchy
	Not guillotined for feminism

The bourgeois revolution, natural rights for all
	Property as natural right
Move fairly slowly
	Don't want to tear everything down
	Keep many groups out
	Keeps the king
	King was important for providing security, head of military
Sans cullottes think they're being left out, peasants, and women feel left out
