Classical music conclusion
Haydn and mozart etc etc etc
Mozart
	Composed at age of 4
	Early stuff, really simple melody

Maria anna, nannerl, also gifted
	Tour as child prodigies
Father forced him to be successful
Composed first opera at 14 years old
	ENded up shouting at court that paid him
Didn't have great people skills
Died at 35

Salieri, wrote operas in 3 languages

Went a bit crazy in the end
